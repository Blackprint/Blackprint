---

Currently the main focus is Blackprint engine and sketch for browser. PHP, Node.js, and Deno engine could have some changes on the future.

## Other possible plan
Blackprint Engine:
- C#
- Lua
- Java (or maybe Kotlin)
- Rust
- Go
- C++

Planned Code Generation:
- Dockerfile
- Create a compiler for compiling 1 Blackprint file into different engine easily

If you're looking for AST, currently you can use the exported Blackprint JSON.

## Some Note
Each engine may have different node compatibilities.<br>
For the example:
 - WebAudio is **only compatible** in the browser.
 - Web server is **not compatible** in the browser.

---

Currently Blackprint will act as an interface for each engine. You will need to write code on how to handle Blackprint node with your library on different programming language.

To use it on NodeJS, Deno, or other JavaScript runtime, you can export it to JSON and use [engine-js](https://github.com/Blackprint/engine-js#example). But it doesn't mean exporting is just like a magic, you also need to write `registerNode` and `registerInterface` on the target engine. Except if someone already write the Addons (node and interface) on target engine, you can easily plug and play.

## Motivation
<details>
  <summary>Personal story</summary>
  FYI, I have used UE4 Blueprint since 2021. Developing a visual script by connecting nodes was my unfinished project since 2014 with ActionScript3 (Adobe Flash). It was very tough because I almost know nothing how to make curve for the cable on AS3. Well, it's not professional to tell a story about my very young age with programming. But the time was passed and I have a feeling like I can continue my old project with my current skill. Thank you Apple for bringing WebKit and Google for V8 engine, and also for everyone who bringing the advanced web technologies.
</details>

The main target of the project is to help developers to modify their program's logic while the program is still running. You can create a custom node so it can be used to manage IoT, Docker container connections, or maybe like virtual cable for electrical stuff. Well, it may feel like a dream but it can be turned into the reality if the community getting bigger.
