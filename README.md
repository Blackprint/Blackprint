  <b>Blackprint Sketch</b> is built using ScarletsFrame (<a href="https://krausest.github.io/js-framework-benchmark/current.html">performance</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ScarletsFiction/ScarletsFrame/wiki#advanced-example">features</a>).
  <br><b>Blackprint Engine</b> is distributed separately for different runtime environment.
  <br><b>Blackprint Editor</b> is created as a <a href="https://github.com/Blackprint/blackprint.github.io">online IDE</a> for browser.
</p>

## Note
Please use Chromium based browser for better rendering performance.

Default Node's UI design was inspired by UE4 Blueprint and can be modified with HTML/CSS. If you're using Blackprint Editor you can choose different theme on the settings, and here's the <a href="https://github.com/Blackprint/blackprint.github.io/blob/ed9cb35fdd0fb79acf2bede4d007e3afd2b40399/src/node-design.scss#L47-L67">code</a> for reference if you want to create your own theme.

## Documentation
> Warning: This project haven't reach it stable version

The documentation haven't been finished, but there are inline documentation on [the template](https://github.com/Blackprint/template-js) and some information on [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Blackprint/Blackprint/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#version-conventions) if you want to use Blackprint before reaching v1.0.0.

## Example

If you're looking for minimal sketch example to get started integrate for your editor project:
- [JSBin](https://jsbin.com/bakulux/edit?html,js,output)
- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/minimal-blackprint?file=index.js)

If you just want to execute exported Blackprint JSON, you can just use the engine. I also provide few simple example for different framework in case you want to use integrate to your frontend framework. For non-browser engine, there are example on it's repository. You can copy and paste the JSON to [Blackprint Editor](https://blackprint.github.io/) to see the nodes arrangement. The example below is using this [arrangement](https://blackprint.github.io/#page/sketch/1#;importSketch:tZHLTsMwEEX_ZdZunEeDiFelVRcguqFLVCETW6lbP6LYqVJV-Xecl5TCEthY9mjuvWfGN_gAcgNlWC35yx7IOxydKy3BOGc6OFnGpbhUgeYO61Lh1aek-bmshPZvw7hdhUESRJgJOxYWudHWSB6okwX0azehy9r9kRdvqCpHskOLYDOQ4ldT-MFvIICECBogafqA4AokCjMEggEBaYqCV9AeEDx3RHgvBePV2jSTMuqVj6MwXY5C2_dFnp5RR7tdh91xobLmQGIESmggiyj0yYo2Xaa_WcdLDxNErcc0tfOJo3QISxBoqrwBPHkm39RX4zuELLlDiP8NYd0j-M1sh_3iHXVHvKulE6W8zvq9dRIPdFk4wqmpbR7yxq0vz_5kGlZfv2eta-eMxnvRvSbFss9aZn1Ums6tN1LkZ85-TrFteD6Yt18).

With remote control you can easily manage connection to the target environment (Node.js/PHP/etc) from the browser. But currently I'm still considering the most efficient and secure way to sync the data remotely, and also which data will be synced. So this will take some time before it's really implemented. Please always run your app inside of container (like Docker) if you allow someone to remote control your system.

Example case where you may need remote control:
 - Creating Discord.js bot (because the library doesn't have support for browser)
   - Support for browser was dropped due to CORS at the Discord endpoint
 - Collaboratively work with your friend
 - Remotely modify your running application in realtime

---

Currently the main focus is Blackprint for JavaScript. PHP, and Golang engine could have some changes on the future.

## Other possible plan
Blackprint Engine:
- **Lua** (because it's embeddable language)
- **Java** (or maybe Kotlin)
- **Rust** (may get removed from this list)
- **C++** (for Arduino if possible)

## Some Note
Each engine may have different compatibilities.<br>
For the example:
 - WebAudio is **only compatible** in the browser.
 - Web server is **not compatible** in the browser.

---

Blackprint will act as an interface for each engine. To use it on NodeJS, Deno, or other JavaScript runtime, you can export it to JSON and use [engine-js](https://github.com/Blackprint/engine-js#example). But it doesn't mean exporting is just like a magic, you also need to write `registerNode` and `registerInterface` on the target engine. Except if someone already write the Blackprint Module (node and interface) on target engine, you can easily plug and play the module.
